# Introduction

In this project, we implement a CNN-based Siamese network for face verification using TensorFlow. We train the model on the CelebA dataset, which contains over 200,000 images of more than 10,000 unique identities. The following sections detail the complete workflow, including the generation of positive and negative pairs, the model architecture, the evaluation metrics, the loss functions, and the experimental results.

# Dataset Download and Pair forming

The CelebA dataset can be downloaded from this https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html or loaded directly using TensorFlowâ€™s API available https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/celeba/load_data. For our implementation, we downloaded the dataset and used the identities annotation file to assign a unique ID to each photo.

Positive pairs were generated by computing all possible combinations of photos belonging to the same identity, and a random sample was then extracted from this pool. Negative pairs were created by randomly pairing photos from different identities.
